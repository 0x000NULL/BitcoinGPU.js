This code assumes the public keys are stored in a file named public_keys.txt, with each key encoded in hexadecimal format and listed on separate lines. It reads the file line by line, decodes each line as a public key, and stores them in the wallet_public_keys vector. Then, it proceeds with generating a random private key and tests it against the public keys read from the file. Adjust the file name or path as needed to match your actual file containing the public keys.

This code opens public_keys.txt to read the public keys, then generates a random private key and tests it against the public keys. If a match is found, the matching private key (in Wallet Import Format - WIF) and its corresponding private key in hexadecimal format are saved to Match.txt. If no match is found, the non-matching private key is saved to an SQLite database named NonMatchingKeys.db. Adjust the database schema and error handling as needed for your specific use case.

This code maintains a progress.txt file that saves the last processed private key in hexadecimal format. When the program starts, it checks if this file exists and if it does, it loads the last processed private key from it to resume the process from where it was stopped. If the file doesn't exist or if it's empty, the program starts from the beginning. After each iteration, the program saves the progress by updating the progress.txt file with the current private key. This allows the program to resume processing from where it left off if it gets stopped or interrupted.
